linux file permissions work in order: user/owner group others without any spaces
xrwxrwxrw (use - to prevent any permissions like -rw------ (gives read and write permission only to owner)
it can also be done via numbers but only 1 digit for each and it will be sum
r : 4
w : 2
x : 1
rwx = 7
-rw = 6
x-w = 3
chmod 750 file owner got xrw group got rw and other ---

umask - change default permission for files. 
ps aux - all running processes with details
| pipe operator : take output of command on left and feed it to right
ps aux | head: get all processes and show top 10(head)

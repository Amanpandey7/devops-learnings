Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package an app with all its dependencies into a lightweight, portable unit called a container.

| VM               | Container                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Full OS + Kernel | Shares Host Kernel               |
| Heavy (GBs)      | Lightweight (MBs)                |
| Slow boot        | Instant start                    |
| Each VM = one OS | Multiple containers share one OS |
